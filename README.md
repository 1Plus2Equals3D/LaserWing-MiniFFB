# Printing
* Please Print with these general orientations
* Use ASA filament or ABS filament because of their heat and chemical resistance
* Each item has the quantities needed listed in the filename if the quantity required is more than one.
* Use 100 or 99% infill. While some of these items are not high stress components , they do protect critical internal parts.
* Shaft to Grip Adapter included is compatible with VKB grips and a VKB 100m extension. 
	* You can mount Virpil and TM grips with 20x20mm extrusion adapters found on Thingiverse

# Tips

I've included a reference 3d model of a assembled unit. 

# Future Releases
Eventually I would like to release this entire project once I decide on a non-commercial license suitable for my kit parts.

Please let me know if you have need for a CAD model, I may be able to help.
